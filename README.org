#+author: Nicola Ferru

[[https://preview.ibb.co/gOTa0y/LAMP_STACK.png]]

A basic LAMP stack environment built using Docker Compose. It consists of the following:
 * PHP
 * Apache
 * MySQL
 * phpMyAdmin
 * Redis

As of now, we have several different PHP versions. Use appropriate php version as needed:
 * 5.4.x
 * 5.6.x
 * 7.1.x
 * 7.2.x
 * 7.3.x
 * 7.4.x
 * 8.0.x
 * 8.2.x
 * 8.3.x

Please note that we simplified the project structure from several branches for each php version, to one centralized master branch. Please let us know if you encouter any problems.

** Installation
 * Clone this repository on your local computer
 * configure ~.env~ as needed
 * Run the ~docker compose up -d~.
#+begin_src shell
  git clone https://github.com/NF02/docker-compose-lamp.git
  cd docker-compose-lamp/
  cp sample.env .env
  // modify sample.env as needed
  docker compose up -d
  // visit localhost
#+end_src
Your LAMP stack is now ready!! You can access it via `http://localhost`.

Thank you!

** Why you shouldn't use this stack unmodified in production
We want to empower developers to quickly create creative Applications. Therefore we are providing an easy to set up a local development environment for several different Frameworks and PHP Versions. 
In Production you should modify at a minimum the following subjects:

 * php handler: mod_php=> php-fpm
 * secure mysql users with proper source IP limitations
